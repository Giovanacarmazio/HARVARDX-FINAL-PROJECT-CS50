# CS50 Final Project

Hey!

Welcome to the final design of Giovana Carmazio's CS50- "Chrome extension!"






## 1




"Chrome extension" is an extension that allows the automatic acceptance of people inside a meeting provided by the google platform.
Google Chrome has created a Google tool that serves as a tool to bring people together online. With the advent of the pandemic, several people decided to use the tool more frequently, adding adjustments for use by several people.

### 2

Each route checks if the user is authenticated. It means if correct mail and password were supplied and what role it has. So for example a teacher cannot enter /students/homeworks/1 route. The same is for student, he cannot enter teacher dashboard route.

###  3

The project.JS has the entire program that was developed, where it is possible to read the data used and other items used. In the style appears the style used and etc.


### 4

INDEX.HTML is the default page within the website's server directories that is loaded whenever a folder is requested, the name of a particular file is not specified, in this case the server itself is in charge of searching the index.html file and delivering for the visitor.

### 5

This is all about my extension, I hope you enjoy playing with it and that it will be useful!

My project was inspired by a difficulty that had the acceptance of several people at the same time in a personal meeting and so I was able to develop a project to solve my problem.
The 2050 harvad course taken in 2021 was a great help in my academic life for my personal development and I love to participate. I had a maximum effort of a few weeks and I feel that it is a profession that I want to follow in the future is the development of artificial intelligence and thus to be a successful programmer. I would love to continue in this area and after I have finished this course I will take the course to develop myself in the pyton area and in the data area. my dream is to be a pyton developer and i want to follow this profession. currently there are already other platforms that make automatic acceptance of people but a google platform does not provide this benefit for free meetings, except that a meeting with a thousand people is a meeting that the platform is not viable due to the acceptance of one by one to enter at the meeting. i really like technology and i intend to follow that profession and the course gave me a lot of knowledge thanks to all the creators who are exceptional and to professor david who is undoubtedly one of the best professionals i have known to date. One day I will be like him, my inspiration is him. Thanks to Edx
